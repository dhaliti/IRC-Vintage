# FT_IRC

This project is about using C++98 to create a personnal IRC server, fully compatible with an official client. 
IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a protocol created in 1988 for real-time text messaging between internet-connected computers. It is mainly used for group discussion in chat rooms called “channels”, although it also supports private messaging between users.

This server is fully comatible with [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/)

To launch the server:
```
make
```
And then:
```
./ircserv <port> <password>
```
